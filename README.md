# Icing

Icing is an open-source microblogging network built on top of the CakePHP framework (and thus, just like every other open source project, the name is a pun). The application is really just an opportunity to explore CakePHP as all of my previous MVC experience has been with CodeIgniter and Ruby on Rails.

## Roadmap

Features to be added/completed sometime in the future (in no particular order):

* A complete (and pretty) responsive user interface
* Replace the password hashing mechanism with something more secure
* User profiles
** Real name, website, biography, location
** Ability to upload an avatar, fall back to Gravatar
* Follow mechanism
* Search
* Hash tags for grouping similar subjects
* JSON API
* RSS feeds
* Retweet-style mechanism
* Ability to favorite posts
* Automatic link parsing
* Track responses to icings so users can follow conversation threads
